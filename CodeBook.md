# Wearable computing

## Original Data

The original data were raw sensor signals produced by 3-axial accelerometers and gyroscope of a smartphone weared by a group of volunteers performing activities. Raw datas were post-processed with various signal processing techniques to measurement vector consisting of 561 features. For detailed description of the original dataset, please see `features_info.txt` in
the zipped dataset file.

## Data sets after applying run_analysis script

The resulting tidy dataset contains one row for each subject / activity pair and columns for subject, activity, and each feature that is issued from a mean or standard deviation calculation from the original dataset.

Use `write.table(sensorAvgByActivityBySubject, file = "sensorAvgByActivityBySubject.txt")` in line 75 of the script (delete or comment `row.name=FALSE` to obtain the dataset with explicit row names.
